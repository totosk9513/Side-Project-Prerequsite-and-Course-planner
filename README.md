Uh.... it would be really hard for now... I don't know GUI at all...

I want to implement a method that solve my struggle when I planning course schedule for 2021 Fall
The solution how I used is:
1. put all sections of courses that u want to take in google calendar
2. then there will be some overlapped sections/courses
3. I trim down these course/sections with my own priorities.
3-1. I can put some conditions based on the conflicts of the coureses, or requirements.
4. yay! u have your course plans!. now we dont have to spamming "next schedule" of CSP or WebReg!!!!!!


ex: lets say there are 2 courses, A and B, and lets say there are 2 prof, X and Y, in the course A. X is good, and Y is bad. you dont want to take Y's A course right?
but well the course B actually conflicts so much with course A!. 
And this case has only two courses! In our real ~~desperate~~ college lyfe, there are usually 4~5 courses! YAY your brain will be boom! 
This happened when I planning 2021 Fall! but well, my algorithm(?) somehow helped me out so much, and I could've successfully(????) have good course **if Rutgers didnt change the cutoff for rounds that bad** 
I WAS ONE POINT BEHIND THE PRIOR ROUND OF MINE, AND COULD NOT REGISTER SOFTMETH ALTHOUGH I AM JUNIOR LOL

However, this probably requires GUI, since users need to see where the overlapped sections/courses there are. 
~~rutgers why did they change the cut offs of the rounds for the pre registration~~
